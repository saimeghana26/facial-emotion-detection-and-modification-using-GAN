# facial-emotion-detection-and-modification-using-GAN

There are two phases in the project: Training, using the trained models in the application.

Input dataset: AffectNet,
Link: http://mohammadmahoor.com/affectnet/

Trained the model with input data set first for 200000 iterations and saved the models.
I used both the trained generator and discriminator in the UI.py file which launches a user interface where the user can upload the picture to detect or modify the emotion of the uploaded picture.
